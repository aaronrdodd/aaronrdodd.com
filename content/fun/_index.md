## Languages

I study foreign languages in my spare time. So far I have reached an
advanced / conversational level in **Japanese**. I'm working to improve my
knowledge of **Romanian** but I'm still at a fairly rudimentary level.

## Programming

I like programming and studying algorithms in my spare time. My current go-to
hobbyist programming languages are **C++**, **Rust**, and **Lisp**. I also
like **Configuration as Code** and **Infrastructure as Code**. My current
obsession has been **NixOS**, which has become an endless source of tweaking
and optimising things and taught me a lot about the Linux world.

All of my projects (including my Nix config) are available on my GitHub.
