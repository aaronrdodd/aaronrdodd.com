I'm a **Software Engineer** specializing in the **.NET** and **React**
ecosystems with more than 7 years of experience. In terms of skills I think
of myself as a **T-shaped** developer; I have a range of skills across the
full-stack of an application but I find that I like working on difficult
problems and I gravitate towards **infrastructure** and **backend** problems
ahead of frontend ones.

See my CV for a full list of my skills and achievements.
